Hereâ€™s a detailed **README.md** file for the **Order Service**:

```markdown
# Order Service

The Order Service is a core microservice in an e-commerce platform. It manages customer orders, checks stock availability via the Inventory Service, deducts stock upon order creation, and listens for stock updates through Kafka to maintain a log of stock changes.

---

## Features

- Create a new order for a specific item.
- Fetch details of an existing order.
- Check stock availability with the Inventory Service.
- Deduct stock upon successful order creation.
- Listen for and log stock update events via Kafka.

---

## Technologies

- **Node.js** with **TypeScript**
- **Express.js** for building the API
- **Mongoose** for MongoDB integration
- **Kafka** for event-driven communication
- **Jest** and **Supertest** for testing

---

## Requirements

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **MongoDB** (local or hosted)
- **Kafka** (e.g., via Docker or a managed service)
- **npm** or **yarn**

---

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd order-service
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following contents:

```plaintext
# Server Configuration
PORT=4000

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/order-service

# Kafka Configuration
KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092

# External Services
INVENTORY_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### Step 4: Start MongoDB and Kafka

Ensure MongoDB and Kafka are running locally or accessible through their respective URIs.

- Start MongoDB (if local):
  ```bash
  mongod
  ```
- Start Kafka (if using Docker Compose):
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

### Step 5: Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3100`.

## API Endpoints

### Base URL: `/api/orders`

#### 1. **Create a New Order**

**POST** `/api/orders/create`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "itemId": "64b5f2c4c8e4fc8d1e3e7b47",
  "quantity": 2
}
```

**Response (201 Created):**
```json
{
  "order": {
    "_id": "64c0a834b94c6c1e3f0c2de7",
    "itemId": "64b5f2c4c8e4fc8d1e3e7b47",
    "quantity": 2,
    "createdAt": "2024-12-03T15:30:20.123Z"
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400 Bad Request`: If stock is insufficient or the request is invalid.

#### 2. **Fetch Order Details**

**GET** `/api/orders/:id`

**Path Parameters:**
- `id`: Order ID.

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "order": {
    "_id": "64c0a834b94c6c1e3f0c2de7",
    "itemId": "64b5f2c4c8e4fc8d1e3e7b47",
    "quantity": 2,
    "createdAt": "2024-12-03T15:30:20.123Z"
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `404 Not Found`: If the order ID does not exist.

---

## Testing the Application

### Unit and Integration Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

### Endpoint Testing with Insomnia/Postman

1. Import the API routes to your tool of choice.
2. Test the `/api/orders/create` and `/api/orders/:id` endpoints.

Example setup for Insomnia:

- **POST** `/api/orders/create`
  - Body: 
    ```json
    {
      "itemId": "64b5f2c4c8e4fc8d1e3e7b47",
      "quantity": 3
    }
    ```

- **GET** `/api/orders/:id`
  - Replace `:id` with the order ID returned by the `create` endpoint.

---

## Design Choices and Assumptions

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

- **Order Entity**: Central to this service, containing order data and logic.
- **Inventory Service Integration**: Treated as a dependency for stock management.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Kafka is used for asynchronous communication and loose coupling.

### Assumptions

1. **Inventory Service Dependency**: Assumes the Inventory Service is functional and available at the configured URL.
2. **Stock Updates via Kafka**: Assumes events are published and consumed in real-time.
3. **Error Handling**: Assumes all unexpected errors will be caught by the global error middleware.

---

## Future Improvements

- Implement authentication and authorization for secure API usage.
- Add pagination for fetching a list of orders.
- Enhance Kafka consumer error handling and retry mechanisms.
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
